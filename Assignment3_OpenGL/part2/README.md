# Description

In the previous part, we rendered a triangle to the screen! There was a bit of setup code involved with SDL and OpenGL to prepare. As a recap:

* We had to initialize SDL and get window and OpenGL Graphics Context
* We had to setup a buffer that contained data for our vertices
* We had a minimal vertex and fragment shader that told OpenGL what to do with that data when we issue a glDraw* command (i.e. we built a graphics pipeline)
* Finally, we use [glDrawArrays](http://docs.gl/gl3/glDrawArrays) to output our data to the screen.

Next we want to render some data in a slightly more efficient way, using what is called an [Index Buffer](https://openglbook.com/chapter-3-index-buffer-objects-and-primitive-types.html). Index buffers allow us to select which vertex data we want to draw using indexes into a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). You will also get some exposure to detecting keyboard input from a user with SDL.

## Task 1 - Setting up your Environment

For this part, you only need run [python build.py](./build.py) to compile the source code from a terminal. If **g++** is not available, you may use clang++.

## Task 2 - Index Buffers

You will find in the code "TODO" sections in the [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp).

Today your goal is to render either a triangle or square based on a keypress:

- You will first need to make sure you have enough vertices to draw two triangles (i.e. exactly 4 vertices)
	- You will need to create an 'index buffer' (i.e. element array buffer).
- Draw a triangle or a square from the same vertex buffer object of data.
    - This means your draw command will draw a different number of indices for the desired shape.
    - Use of [SDL_Input](https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory#Input_Events) or SDL_GetKeyboardState() to press a key.
      - If a user presses the 'left arrow key' a triangle appears
      - If a user presses rhe 'right arrow key' a rectangle appears

Note: Think about how you might want to implement this functionality -- it is okay if you make changes to the provided code.

# Submission/Deliverables

### Submission

- Commit all of your files to github, including any additional files you create.
- Do not commit any binary files unless told to do so.
- Do not commit any 'data' files generated when executing a binary.

### Deliverables

- A triangle or a square (using glDrawElements) depending on which indices are selected to render.
    - If a user presses 'left arrow key' a triangle appears
    - If a user presses 'right arrow key' a square appears

# F.A.Q. (Instructor Anticipated Questions)

1. Q: Can I modify the code to handle keypresses?
	- A: Yes you will have to. Consider adding some variable to store the state of the last key press, or otherwise to change the number of triangles you would like to render.

# Going Further

What is that, you finished Early? Did you enjoy this lab/assignment? Here are some (optional) ways to further this assignment.

- Add colors to your shapes! We will work on this next week, and figure out how to add attributes! Note that the provided shaders will work with color as is if you move ahead.

# Found a bug?

If you found a mistake (big or small, including spelling mistakes) in this lab, kindly send me an e-mail. It is not seen as nitpicky, but appreciated! (Or rather, future generations of students will appreciate it!)

- Fun fact: The famous computer scientist Donald Knuth would pay folks one $2.56 for errors in his published works. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)]
- Unfortunately, there is no monetary reward in this course :)
