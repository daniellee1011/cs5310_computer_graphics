* Core is the material everyone can get through. I expect everyone to complete this. Coming to class, listening to lectures, and reviewing materials should be sufficient.
* Intermediate is a little more difficult. Very likely you will have to utilize office hours, piazza, etc.
* Advanced is more challenging. You will have to spend more time and very likely use outside materials. I do not expect everyone to complete the advanced section.
